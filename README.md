# Car-detection-and-tracking-using-YOLOv3-v3

In this project we use a pretrained model to detect vechiles then start tracking them using deepsort

# How to use it

You will need to transfer Yolov3 into tensorflow and for that you have to run convert.py

Note: you can run this model on the gpu if you set up tensorflow on the gpu. However, it runs on the cpu by default
